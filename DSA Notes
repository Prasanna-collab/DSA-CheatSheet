How we can say which code is best? for one feature there are multiple solutions are there right!.

By checking the code using Execution Time?
  when we perform the time difference between different operations to complete we will get the time taken by the fucntion.
but it depends onthe system capacity, it will change with each request. so its is not reliable. so we cannot take ths as actuall measuing tool.

if not time then what?
count the number of operations computer has to perform.

By Checking the code using Space taken by it?
